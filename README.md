## Overview

## The Project

The attempt was to build a fairly primitive but functional music lyric app to try and solidify my fetch api skills. It's unassuming but it works and I'm proud of it, and if I were to find an API with more data that I can use, I just might update it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- Fetch API

### Continued development

Perhaps an update might see a more polished UI, use of a faster API, and more data provided; something closer to Genius.
